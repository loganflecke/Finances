# Finances

`spending.ipynb` will perform data processing and analysis on credit card and banking information.

`Official Budget.xlsx`, Banking, and Transaction data will remain locally, with the relative directory path specified in the beginning of the IPYNB file.

The `spending.ipynb` script will output a `budget.xlsx` file that is the current status and analysis of budget information.
