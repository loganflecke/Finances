# ROADMAP

## List of Wants for this Project

1. Analyze expenses and income for proportions of spent, invested, and saved
   1. Optionally to identify proportions saved to different accounts
2. Determine forecasted amount saved/invested by years and the rate of increase
3. Build support for scenarios (if I buy this, how much will it cost per (month, year, one time) and how will that impact my savings?)
4. Expense ROI to determine what expenses hurt the most over time, particularly discretionary expenses
5. Recurring expense without specifying them
6. Guidance of proportion to invest, save, and spend, then determine where to invest, save, and spend
